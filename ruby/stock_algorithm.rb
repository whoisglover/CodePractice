# stock_algorithm.rb

# I have an array stock_prices_yesterday where:

# The indices are the time, as a number of minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
# The values are the price of Apple stock at that time, in dollars.
# For example, the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, so stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.

# Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday. For this problem, we won't allow "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell.

# brute-force pseudo code:
# 1. enumerate all buy, sell pairs
# 2. keep track of the largest difference
# 3. return difference

stock_prices_yesterday = [3,3,4,5,3,1,5,6,8,9,4,12,11,10,14,14,14,18,15]

# brute-force analysis:
# time: O(n^2) due to two nested loops
# space: O(1) constant, no new arrays created just a constant amount of variables

#Greedy Approach - We can get time complexity to O(n)
#Pseudocode:
# 1. Keep lowest price seen so far
# 2. Keep max profit
# 3. Check if sellling at each point and buying at lowest so far is greater than max profit so far

p best_profit_from_yesterday_greedy(stock_prices_yesterday)

#greedy analysis:
# 1. O(n) time!! Only one pass thru the array
# 2. O(1) space still only a constant number of variables

#Notes from solution:
# use more ruby helper functions instead of if's i.e. lowest_thus_far = min(lowest_thus_far, current_price)
# max_profit = max(max_profit, current_price - lowest_thus_far)
